                <h5>Space Issues</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seating areas were crowded with shoppers and non-shoppers alike.<br></li>
                    <li>Customers had difficulties using the mirrors due to overcrowded conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Information-seeking Issues</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customers expect staff to be knowledgeable about the products they stock.<br></li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Customers had a lot of idle time waiting for staff to come back with their shoes.<br></li>
                    <li>Staff had to make multiple trips to the stockroom to get sizes for different shoes for the same customer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We were overwhelmed by the vast findings of the online and offline shoe shopping experience. Due to the limited time, we decided to prioritise on the in-store shopping experience and consider online as the next steps. <br></p>
